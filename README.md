# Signal-Handler
Write two programs that handle different signals

This was a programming assignment for CS 354, Intro to Computer Systems, Spring 2017

In this assignment, I wrote two programs, one that hand the user signal Ctrl^C to exit the infinite program that allowed the user to do simple math calculations, and the other that handled signals sent by an external program.
